# Voice recognition using google, or xunfei

Today, when I transcripting the interiview mp3, I do some literature searching on internet. The most promising file will be:

1. autosub
you can use the command
```
autosub -S zh-CN -D zh-CN -f srt -k thegoogleapikey filename
```
to transcibe the mp3 to srt, with time frame.

It's great.

2. xunfei yun and tencent cloud

on these two, I didn't try.
