### the Dangling Links in Pageranks

In reading the PageRank original paper "[The PageRank Citation Ranking: Bring Order to the Web]" (http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/422/1/1999-66.pdf).
There is a paragraph discuss on the dangling links. It discussed that "...dangling links do not affect the ranking of any other pages directly..."
Maybe to the math/cs students, the conclusion is clear but it quite confusiing to a student without cs/math background.

But we can use a Excel simulation to test that. The followint is an example.

In the figure, E is a dangling link, we can simulate the Pagerank process in two ways.
*Without outbound links from E.

the whole process illustrated in the fillowing figure.

The dangling link page (E) hasn't change the pagerank value of the other fives.
